# Exercise - Setup your environment

During this exercise you will setup your environment for the workshop.
Please follow these steps:

## Create a Docker Hub account

We will need a Docker Hub account all along the workshop, to use `Play With Docker` and to push/pull images to your own repository.

**1.** If you already have a Docker Hub account, go directly to step 5
**2.** Open a browser and go to https://hub.docker.com

**3.** Sign up with a `login`, `password` and email
**4.** Check your mailbox and confirm your email

**5.** Sign in Docker Hub

## Play With Docker

This workshop is tuned to be used with [Play With Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com), so everyone can have the same experience and we don't rely on WiFi to push/pull Giga Bytes of images.
You can still follow the instructions locally with your own engine.

**1.** Open a browser and go to https://labs.play-with-docker.com

**2.** Click on the `Login` dropdown, choose `Docker` and sign in using your `Docker Hub` credentials

**3.** Start !

**4.** A new session is opened, which will be closed in 4 hours. You can add multiple new instances and delete them. Each one has it's own engine and own prompt. You can also ssh directly to it if you feel more comfortable with your own term. Now **add a new instance**.

**5.** Login to the Docker Hub using your credentials

```sh
$ docker login
Login with your Docker ID to push and pull images from Docker Hub. If you don't have a Docker ID, head over to https://hub.docker.com to create one.

**6.** We prepared an image containing everything needed for the workshop (docker CLI, docker-compose, docker-app, swarm, ...) and your prefered editors (nano, emacs, even vi!). Please run it, everything will happen in this container. 

```sh
$ docker run -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /root:/workshop dapworkshop/workshop
